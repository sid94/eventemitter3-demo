# eventemitter3-demo

To start the project

```
npm ci
```

To run the demo start index.js and consumeemitter.js

like in a browser's <script>, as soon as you require a module the code is parsed and executed so index.js will start emitting as soon as you start consumeemitter.js.

```
node consumeemitter.js
```
